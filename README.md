The recent emergence of machine learning and deep learning methods for medical image analysis has enabled the development of intelligent medical imaging-based diagnosis systems that can assist physicians in making better decisions about a patient’s health. In particular, skin imaging is a field where these new methods can be applied with a high rate of success. 

This thesis focus on the problem of automatic skin lesion detection,  particularly on melanoma detection, by applying semantic segmentation and classification from dermoscopic images using a deep learning based approach. 

For the first problem, the U-Net convolutional neural network architecture is applied for an accurate extraction of the lesion region. 

For the second problem, the model begins with a particularization for a binary classification of early melanoma detection that can be generalized to multi-class skin lesion classification.  The proposed solution is built around the VGG-Net ConvNet architecture and uses the transfer learning paradigm. 

Finally, this work performs an evaluation of mixing the two approaches by trying to achieve better accuracies on the classification method.

Experimental results for the classification task are encouraging: on the ISIC Archive dataset, the proposed method achieves an accuracy on the top three best previously published results. The experimental results of the segmentation evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform other state-of-the-art models.
